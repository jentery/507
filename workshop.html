<a name="description" class="anchor" href="#description"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Workshop: Thought Piece Review</h3>

<p>For this seminar meeting (Tuesday, January 27th), you'll workshop your <a href="log2.html">thought pieces</a>. During the workshop, you should meet with three different people for approximately 45 minutes each. As you meet, you should not only discuss each other's thought pieces; you should also write (in your research log) a brief review of each thought piece (three total), addressing the following questions:<ul>
<li>What's persuasive about the thought piece? To whom is it relevant?</li>
<li>How could the research question and scope be refined?</li>
<li>How feasible is the argument given the time constraints at hand? How could the feasibility be increased?</li>
<li>What are some of the technical challenges? Some of the research challenges? How significant are they?</li>
<li>How tight is the relationship between the research question and the choice of new media / computation? How could that relationship be tightened? Does the type of argument selected seem like a good fit?</li>
<li>What, if anything, is missing from the recipe? What tools, research, data sources, and projects might be added? What other arguments or publications come to mind? (Use the internet to find some answers here?)</li>
<li>What other comments or suggestions do you have?</ul></p> 

<p>Before you leave seminar on the 27th, please make sure you add your three separate reviews (each addressing the above questions) to your research log and push the changes to your GitHub account. You may also want to make sure you are following your peers' GitHub repos or that you have their URLs. That way, you can access (and even copy) their feedback for you after the workshop and then revise your work accordingly.</p>
