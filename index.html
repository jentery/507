      <h1>"Arguing with Computers"</h1>

      <p>This seminar introduces you to making arguments about literature, history, and culture through new media and computation. It is also a survey of methods and debates across digital humanities and media studies.</p>
 
<h3><a name="week1" class="anchor" href="#week1"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>January 6th (Meeting 1): Hermeneutics + Computers</h3>
<p><em>During Hermes's tedious monologue, all of Argus's many eyes gradually close in sleepiness, and his fate is sealed. Argus, in essence, was bored to death by the most boring thing of all, tales about technology.</em> --- Alexander Galloway, "Love of the Middle"</p>
<p><strong>Hello World:</strong> Introducing Us + the Seminar<br>
<strong>Discussion:</strong> Let's begin the seminar with a conversation about the role of literary and cultural criticism today, in what we might call (for better or worse) an age of algorithms, networks, and digital technologies. Why does hermeneutic interpretation matter or remain relevant in our current moment? How (if at all) does hermeneutic practice change with or through computation? How is it expressed in media other than print or electronic text? Does literary or cultural criticism simply respond to technological developments? Or can it spark them, intervene in them, or repurpose them? Don't computers just make hermeneutics tedious and boring? Don't they just reduce literature to mere data? <a href="notes1.html">(notes)</a><br>

<strong>Reminder:</strong> Please tell me what computer you will be using, version included. Also, it would be great if you could come to the first seminar meeting having already selected a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor" target="_blank">text editor</a> for the semester.

<h3><a name="week2" class="anchor" href="#week2"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>January 13th (Meeting 2): Digging + Distancing</h3>
<p><em>The text is no longer composed of strata and the critic does not burrow down but stands back. Instead of brushing past surface meanings in pursuit of hidden truth, she dwells in ironic wonder on these surface meanings, seeking to “denaturalise” them through the mercilessness of her gaze. Insight, we might say, is achieved by distancing rather than by digging.</em> --- Rita Felski, "Critique and the Hermeneutics of Suspicion"</p>

<strong>Discussion:</strong> For this seminar meeting, let's stress the relationships between mediation and critique, or new media and critical practice. Is critique just mediation all the way down? Has it run out of steam? What motivates claims for "post-critical" scholarship? How do we think about mediation and critique together? Or how do we understand the histories of technology and literary/cultural criticism as entangled phenomena? Can mediation even be historicized? Wouldn't such a history require some significant interpretive leaps? <a href="notes2.html">(notes)</a><br>

<h3><a name="week3" class="anchor" href="#week3"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>January 20th (Meeting 3): Permanence + Ephemerality</h3>
<p><em>If our machines' memories are more permanent, if they enable a permanence that we seem to lack, it is because they are constantly refreshed so that their ephemerality endures, so that they may store the programs that seem to drive our machines.</em> --- Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, "The Enduring Ephemeral, or the Future Is a Memory"</p>

<strong>Log Entry Due:</strong> <a href="log1.html">After Hermes?</a><br>  
<strong>Discussion:</strong> This week, I would like to focus on new media as both object and method. How are new media studied as scholarly objects, and how are they integrated into modes/means of scholarly production? How can we make arguments about mediation through new media, and to what effects on our expectations of scholarly communication? How and under what assumptions do we approach new media as historical material? For instance, when and why does it matter that we are studying digital versions of analog/print materials? Or what assumptions motivate references to "source" code? <a href="notes3.html">(notes)</a><br>

<p><em>Speculative approaches make it possible for subjective interpretation to have a role in shaping the processes, not just the structures, of digital humanities.

<strong>Log Entry Due:</strong> <a href="log2.html">Thought Piece</a><br> 
<strong>Discussion:</strong> During this seminar meeting, let's attend primarily to how data models, prototypes, and design play a unique role in digital scholarship. In the context of new media and computation, what's a data model? Why do modeling and prototyping matter when arguing with computers? Before they are executed or enacted, how are models and prototypes already arguments? How are they embedded in culture? How are they standardized, how can they foster conjecture or speculation, and to what effects? Generally speaking, how do they turn this into that?<br>   
<strong>Workshop:</strong> <a href="workshop.html">Thought Piece Review</a><br>  
<strong>Reminder:</strong> For this meeting, I am asking you to circulate your thought piece for feedback. I am also asking you to provide feedback on thought pieces by three other people in 507. Additionally, please become familiar with McCarty's use of "model of" and "model for" (via Geertz), Drucker and Nowviskie's notion of "speculative computing," Balsamo's "ten lessons about technoculture innovation," and Galey and Ruecker's checklist for reviewing prototypes. Thanks!</p>

<strong>Log Entry Due:</strong> Revised Thought Piece (prompt coming soon)<br>
<strong>Discussion:</strong> This week, let's have a conversation about surface + distance reading in the context of hermeneutic interpretation, including the ethical, reflexive, affective, and epistemological dimensions of surface + distant reading. Plainly put, is surface or distant reading simply hermeneutic interpretation by another name? From another perspective/position? Or are they "post-hermeneutic"? To what degree are both about faith in computation? What are we to make of appeals to "surprise" in critical practice? Do we need computers to afford such surprise? For instance, to what degree does collaborative work afford conditions for interpretation similar to the distance prompted by computation? (notes coming soon)<br>

<h3><a name="week6" class="anchor" href="#week6"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>February 17th (Meeting 6): Deformations + Transformations</h3>
<p><em>One could do worse than to recall, even in this special aesthetic frame of reference, Marx's last thesis on Feuerbach. Only philosophers try to understand art. The point is to change it. Our actions on these works, as on anything else in our experience, allow us to begin to understand our thinking about them. To essay a more direct application of "interpretation" to poetical work runs the risk of suggesting that interpretation can be adequate to poiesis. It cannot; it can only run a thematic experiment with the work, enlightening it by inadequacy and indirection. In a hermeneutic age like our own, illusions about the sufficiency of interpretative meaning before the work of art are especially strong. At such a historical moment one might rather look for interpretations that flaunt their subjectivity and arbitrariness, interpretations that increase their value by offering themselves at a clear discount.</em> --- Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann, "Deformance and Interpretation"</p>

<strong>Discussion:</strong> For this seminar meeting, we'll look at the tensions and overlaps between deformation and transformation as interpretive practices. How do critique and art function algorithmically? Under what assumptions, and through what histories? How are algorithms conducive to racism, sexism, exploitation, and supremacy? What subtends the determinacy of method? Or calls for play in scholarship? What should be the functions of algorithms in literary or cultural criticism? How is algorithmic criticism also about control? Does either deformance or transformance assume that form is stable or ahistorical? That essence exists? Is all interpretation necessarily deformative or transformative? Ultimately, what are the relationships between deformance, transformance, and hermeneutics? Where are their politics?

<strong>Log Entry Due:</strong> Abstract for Your Final Essay (prompt coming soon)<br>
<strong>Discussion:</strong> This week we'll talk about formal and cultural approaches to interfaces. Where are interfaces? How are they at once treated systematically and experimentally, through standards and as illusive forms of mediation? How (if at all) does hermeneutic interpretation engage an interface? Are interfaces windows or edges? How are interfaces rendered accessible, by whom, and for whom? What does it mean to call an interface "intuitive" or "natural"? How do we understand interfaces as entanglements of human and computer relations? How are interfaces cognitive as well as affective experiences?<br> 
<strong>Workshop:</strong> Review of the Seminar + Workshops Thus Far (notes coming soon)<br> 
<strong>Reminder:</strong> Your final essay is due Tuesday, April 14th. Before Tuesday, March 31st, feel free to send me a draft for feedback. In the meantime, as you read, please define the following terms in your own words: machine act, operator act, performative materiality, and interface. Thanks!<br>
<strong>Also:</strong> As an extension of the <a href="http://dhsi.org/" target="-blank">Digital Humanities Summer Institute</a>, I'm holding a free, two-day Python workshop for humanities grad students. It's on campus this weekend. Please let me know if you'd like to attend. There may still be room available.</p>

<h3><a name="week9" class="anchor" href="#week9"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>March 10th (Meeting 9): Translating + Switching</h3>
<p><em>Getting anything done generally requires the collaboration of people who do different kinds of work, and whose various kinds of work has shaped various kinds of thinking. It calls for some kind of translation or code switching. It can be hard enough getting people who do different kinds of intellectual labor aligned towards a common task. Collaborations between mental and manual labor, not to mention affective labor, rather complicates the whole endeavor. So perhaps it would be a start for those of us who do some kind of intellectual labor to practice some code switching.</em> --- McKenzie Wark, "Against Social Determinism"</p>

<strong>Log Entry Due:</strong> Tech Specs for Your Argument with a Computer (prompt coming soon)<br>	 
<strong>Discussion:</strong> This week the focus is translating the work of 507 (in particular) and digital studies (in general) into contexts beyond the seminar. How do we communicate the relevance of what we do? How does collaboration happen across groups, fields, and even sectors? Where technical or computational work is concerned, when (if ever) should the humanities be instrumentalist? How do expectations, values, protocols, and codes shift across sectors, and to what effects on the arguments we make with computers? How do humanities grad students receive the sort of training or opportunities they want/need for collaborative work? For laboratory work? For computational work? For social justice work?<br> 
<strong>Reminder:</strong> Next week, you'll share the arguments you're making with computers. We'll treat them as prototypes (of a sort). At some point this week, feel free to ask me any questions you have or send me drafts of your argument. Also, wherever possible, determine how you'll share your argument and data (where applicable) online (e.g., via GitHub).</p>

<strong>Log Entry Due:</strong> Draft Essay (prompt coming soon)<br>  
<strong>Discussion:</strong> With your presentations next week, this is our last proper seminar meeting, which will involve looking specifically at how digital labour and networks (as scholarly objects and scholarly practices) play a role in digital studies. How is digital labour embodied? How is it quantified or rendered immaterial? How it is exploited? For practitioners, what can networks and online environments do for scholarship that other approaches cannot? How do we understand exchange, justice, attribution, and responsibility in networked environments? How are digital labour practices influencing the space of place? (notes coming soon)<br> 
<strong>Workshop:</strong> How to Use <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/index.html" target="_blank">Pandoc</a> to Convert Files (notes coming soon)<br>
<strong>Reminder:</strong> If you would like to use Pandoc during the workshop, then please <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html" target="_blank">install it</a>. Also, be sure to touch base with any concerns about the final presentation and essay, both of which are due soon. Finally, as you read, do your best to articulate how digital labour differs from and overlaps with other forms of labour, especially how it's embodied, performed, quantified, and tracked.</p>

<p><em>I gesticulated. I marked in the text where to look up at the audience. I marked in the text where to slow down to deliver the punchlines to maximum effect. (This also allows people to live tweet better; they're better able to quote you correctly.) When people laughed, I waited for them to stop, and I smiled at them. I also managed my slides in the same way I've done for years, but which many people on Twitter stopped to remark on: I show blank/black slides in between content-laden slides. I don't know about you but when there's a slide and someone talking, I compulsively try to relate the image to the talking. So if I just want people to focus on what I'm saying, and there's nothing I need them to look at, I just black out the screen. Pictures when relevant, blank when not.</em> --- Aimée Morrison, "Keynote! Tips for Presenting to a Big Crowd"</p>
